# Tetris

Since Tetris is one of my favorite puzzle games of all time, I wanted to work on it after Snake. This development process went far smoother than Snake did. Like Snake, I designed the game board to be a grid of equally sized cubes. However, I did not have the same problems with movement and collision detection that I did with Snake. I believe this is because the predictability of the game pieces make it easy to compare the bounds of the game pieces with the bounds of the game board. I also initialized each tile of the game board to be gray when it is empty. Using colors meant I did not have to worry about setting up a tilemap like I did with Snake. This allowed me to easily check the colors of the game board to see where the pieces are and if I need to clear lines of the game. I enjoyed developing the game quite a bit. 

Controls: 
Left Arrow Key: Move one tile to the left
Right Arrow Key: Move one tile to the Right
Down Arrow Key: Move one tile down
A Key: Rotate left
D Key: Rotate Right
Space Bar: Move down as far as the pieces can go
Left Tab Key: Save/Retrieve piece
